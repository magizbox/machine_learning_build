    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes the average of many decision trees, each of which is made with a sample of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree is weaker than a full decision tree, but by combining them we get better overal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "A sort of \"wisdom of the crowd\". Tends to result in very high quality models. Fast to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can be slow to output predictions relative to other algorithms\n",
    "* Not easy to understand predictions."
