    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of support vector machines are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "* Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "* Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "* Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of support vector machines include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "* SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below)."
